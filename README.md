# üéÆ Tetris-Clone

Welcome to **Tetris-Clone**, a modern take on the classic puzzle game built in **C#** using **WPF**!

This project began as a hands-on C# learning experience following the excellent [OttoBotCode YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/@OttoBotCode), and was later expanded with custom features to make the game more polished and engaging.
